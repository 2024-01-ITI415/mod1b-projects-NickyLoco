# Module1-Projects

 ApplePicker:
 -User controls a basket using their mouse input
 -Failure to catch an apple uses up 1/3 lives. Go for the high score!
 
 Mission Demolition:
 -User controls slingshot with mouse input
 -The camera follows the projectile. Knock down castles to win.
 
 Prototype 1: UFO Attack!
-The goal of this prototype was to experiment with the functions from the previous games.
-I focused on the MDA framework and transformed mechanics from Apple Picker and Mission Demolition into something different.
-The UFOs are an obstacle for the player, who needs to get the goal above the mothership.
-The player can run out of lives if they take too long.
-Complete 3 waves of increasing difficulty to win.
